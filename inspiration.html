<p> 
    Life brings us as many joyful moments as it does downfalls, <br>
    and although there are days we wish there was a manual to follow, <br>
    it simply wouldn't be the same without the spontaneity. 
</p> <br>

<p>
    You fall, you rise, you make mistakes, you live, you learn. <br>
    You are human not perfect.
</p> <br> 

<p>
    I know sometimes you feel like giving up. <br>
    I know you have good days and bad days. <br>
    I know everyday you question yourself. <br>
    I know you have more questions than answers. <br>
    You have to rise above the waters of your soul and bloom, no matter how hot the fire is. <br>
    No matter how many arrows you carry you carry on your back, believe me, you are a warrior. <br>
    You are a soldier filled with both pain and love. <br>
    And life, well life is just another beast you were meant to tame. 
</p> <br>

<p>
    The journey of life may not become easier as we grow older, <br>
    but we do seem to understand it better as our perspectives evolve.
</p> <br>

<p>
    You have so much potential and so many things left to do. <br>
    You have time. Better things are coming your way. <br>
    Please hang in there. You can do it!
